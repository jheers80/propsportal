# Prep Planner System Cleanup - Complete Guide

## Overview
The prep-planner system has been completely removed and replaced with a simple landing page for future task management system development.

## Files Created for Cleanup

### 1. `cleanup_prep_planner_database.sql`
**Purpose:** Standard cleanup script for known prep-planner tables
**Usage:** Run in Supabase SQL Editor
**Contains:**
- Drops specific prep tables: `prep_schedules`, `prep_items`, `prep_task_lists`, `prep_planner_settings`, `prep_calculation_rules`, `prep_forecast_inputs`
- Removes related indexes, functions, and triggers
- Cleans up features and permissions tables
- Includes verification queries

### 2. `comprehensive_prep_cleanup.sql`  
**Purpose:** Dynamic cleanup that finds ALL prep-related tables automatically
**Usage:** Run in Supabase SQL Editor for thorough cleanup
**Features:**
- Uses dynamic SQL to find any table with 'prep' in the name
- Automatically handles foreign key constraints
- Removes triggers, indexes, functions dynamically
- Provides detailed logging of cleanup actions
- Includes comprehensive verification at the end

### 3. `verify_prep_cleanup.sql`
**Purpose:** Verification script to confirm complete cleanup
**Usage:** Run after cleanup scripts to verify success
**Checks:**
- Remaining prep tables
- Remaining prep functions  
- Remaining prep features in features table
- Remaining prep permissions in permissions table
- Orphaned role_permissions entries
- Prep-related audit trail entries

## Application Changes

### Removed Directories/Files:
- `src/app/prep-planner/` (all pages except new landing page)
- `src/app/api/prep-planner/` (all API routes)
- `src/components/prep-planner/` (all components)
- `src/lib/prep-planner/` (types and utilities)
- `docs/prep-planner/` (documentation)
- All `prep_planner_*.sql` schema files

### Created:
- `src/app/prep-planner/page.tsx` - New landing page with "Coming Soon" message

## Database Tables Removed

Based on the cleanup scripts, the following tables are/were removed:
- `prep_schedules` - Task scheduling data
- `prep_items` - Prep task definitions  
- `prep_task_lists` - Task list groupings
- `prep_planner_settings` - Location-specific settings
- `prep_calculation_rules` - Business rule calculations
- `prep_forecast_inputs` - Forecasting input data

## Recommended Cleanup Process

1. **Run the comprehensive cleanup first:**
   ```sql
   -- Execute: comprehensive_prep_cleanup.sql
   ```

2. **Verify the cleanup was successful:**
   ```sql
   -- Execute: verify_prep_cleanup.sql
   ```

3. **Optional: Run standard cleanup as backup:**
   ```sql
   -- Execute: cleanup_prep_planner_database.sql (if needed)
   ```

## Database Setup Files Status

The main database setup files are clean and accurate:
- ✅ `database_setup.sql` - No prep-planner references
- ✅ `complete_database_setup.sql` - No prep-planner references

These files will NOT recreate any prep-planner tables when run.

## New Landing Page Features

The new prep-planner landing page includes:
- Authentication check and redirect to login if needed
- Loading state with spinner
- "Coming Soon" message for task management system
- List of planned features:
  - Task scheduling and management
  - Team assignments
  - Progress tracking
  - Automated notifications
  - Performance analytics
- Return to Portal button
- Clean, responsive Material-UI design

## Verification Steps

After running cleanup scripts, verify:
1. No prep tables exist in database
2. No prep-related functions exist
3. No prep-related features in features table
4. No prep-related permissions in permissions table
5. Application loads without errors
6. Prep-planner page shows new landing page
7. No broken links or 404 errors when accessing `/prep-planner`

## Future Development

The landing page is ready for future task management system development. The clean slate allows for:
- New database schema design
- Modern component architecture
- Updated API design
- Improved user experience

## Notes

- All cleanup scripts are safe to run multiple times
- Verification script can be run anytime to check status  
- Landing page maintains consistent navigation with rest of application
- No prep-planner code remains in the codebase
- Database setup files are accurate and won't recreate prep tables
